# HighTemperatureDetector
# How High Temperature Detectors Work:
Sensing: The temperature sensor continuously measures the temperature of the environment or system it's monitoring.
Processing: The sensor's data is processed by the detector's control circuitry, which compares the current temperature to the preset threshold.
Triggering Action: If the temperature exceeds the threshold, the detector activates an alarm, sends a signal to shut down equipment, or turns on a cooling system.
